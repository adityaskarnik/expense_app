Welcome to Expense App :dollar:

  

Do you receive an email from your bank about your last transaction? Each email tracks need to be logged as an expense. Daily keeping track of each expense made, is lost in the email lot. Let the App do the hard work and keep you free from it.
See all expenses, analyse on what you spend most, so that you can reduce them.
